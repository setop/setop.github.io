I am Michael Grünewald, the author of the texts on this site.  I am
also DevOps officer at [quintly](https://quintly.com), tomorrow's
leading social media analytics solution.  I previously worked as a
math researcher (algebraic geometry and representation theory of
reductive groups), as a financial mathematician and software
developer.


## Development and Operations

Cloud technologies shifted the frontier between hardware and software,
allowing us to program tasks like “setup a computer in this computer
center” or “change disks of that computer” instead of performing them
physically.  Together with the ongoing research in software
development methodologies, which evolved to replace pharaonic projects
carried out by a state by iterative developments attainable by an
enthusiastic programmer, these two changes opened a world of
opportunities to be taken.


## Financial mathematician

As a financial mathematician at
[much-net AG](http://www.much-net.de) I endorsed the roles of a
quantitative analyst, supervising the pricing (including VaR,
sensitivies and other more advanced metrics) of a large (more than
150) exotic derivatives, and of a programmer, optimizing
[PMS](https://www.much-net.de/en/product/portfolio-management.html)
internal models for time and speed ([LMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIBOR_market_model)) and implementing new ones
(quantum LMM).


## Mathematical research

I wrote my PhD thesis “Varieties of reductions for reductive algebraic
groups” under the co-direction of [Laurent Manivel][laurent-home] and
[Nicolas Ressayre][nicolas-home].  This work contributes to the
classification of Fano varieties, a crucial problem in birational
geometry and contemporary physics, by investigating the varieties of
reductions for a reductive algebraic group first defines by Atanas
Iliev and Laurent Manivel.

After defending my PhD, I spent one year as a guest scientist at the
[MPIM](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de) and one year at the
[Hausdorff Center for Mathematics](http://www.hausdorff-center.uni-bonn.de),
where I constructed
[a universal family for the subgroups of an algebraic group](/assets/math/1005.0748v1.pdf) (as an ind-variety).

## Technical bits about this site's backend

This site uses the base Jekyll theme and is hosted on GitHub.
Articles are written using the
[kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) variant of
markdown. It uses synthax highlighting from
[rouge](http://rouge.jayferd.us/demo).
