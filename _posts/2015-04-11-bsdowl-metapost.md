[METAPOST][metapost-home] is powerful language for creating technical
drawings and a program my John Hobby, it is found in most if not all
**TeX** distributions.  While most **LaTeX** compilation assistants do not pay
much attention to **METAPOST**, it is very well integrated in
[BSD Owl Scripts][bsdowl-home] so that preparing a **LaTeX** document
containing beautiful **METAPOST** pictures is achieved by a Makefile as simple
as

~~~ makefile
DOCUMENT=		galley.tex
SRCS+=			figures.mp
.include "latex.doc.mk"
~~~

It is also possible to produce pictures for themselves, using a
Makefile similar to

~~~ makefile
DOCUMENT=		figures.mp
MPDEVICE=		eps pdf png svg
.include "mpost.doc.mk"
~~~

It will produce EPS, PDF, PNG and SVG versions of the figures.


If you do not know **METAPOST** here are few figures drawn with it:

![A performance comparison chart][example-chart]
![A timeline][example-timeline]
![A UML diagram][example-uml]

These pictures are [examples][blueprint-example] found in my
[Blueprint][blueprint-home] project, a library of **METAPOST**
definitions. This project also illustrates the use of **BSD Owl Scripts**
to produce METAPOST pictures.
